an app to display NYC PLUTO data in augmented reality

by Matt Ward - part of my Hunter College Masters in Geoinformatics thesis project

This webxr AR app uses data from the [New York City PLUTO](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) (Property Land Use Tax Lot Output) dataset, maintained by the NYC Dept. of Planning.

The PLUTO attribute information displayed within the app is explained in the [PLUTO Data Dictionary](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf?v=21v4).

Here are some tips for getting the best experience using this app:

1. Use it on a smartphone.
2. Android - use Chrome; iPhone - use Mozilla's [WebXR Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056) browser.
3. If you're using an Android phone, before you load the app stand facing as close to 'North' as possible.
4. Before loading, hold your phone roughly parallel with the ground.
5. Tap the turqoise cubes that appear on your screen, they represent PLUTO tax lot centroids near you.
6. Once you tap a cube, the transparent overlay that appears can be scrolled left/right and up/down with your finger to view the PLUTO information.
7. You can move around, but you'll need to reload the page to get new nearby PLUTO properties (if you leave an area).
8. Please be aware of your surroundings while using the app!
