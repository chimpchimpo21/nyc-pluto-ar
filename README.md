an app to display NYC PLUTO data in augmented reality

by Matt Ward - part of my Hunter College Master of Geoinformatics thesis project

This webxr ar app uses data from the [New York City PLUTO](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) (Property Land Use Tax Lot Output) dataset, maintained by the NYC Dept. of Planning.

Here are some tips for getting the best experience using this app:

1. Use it on a smartphone
2. Android - use Chrome; iPhone - use Mozilla's [WebXR Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056) browser
3. Before loading, stand facing as close to 'North' as possible
4. Before loading, hold your phone at a roughly 45-degree angle with the ground
5. Tap the turqoise cubes that appear on your screen, those are the nearby PLUTO lots
6. The info box at the top of the screen can be scrolled left/right and up/down with your finger to view the PLUTO information
7. Once loaded, you can move around, but you'll need to reload the page to get current PLUTO properties if you move out of the area
